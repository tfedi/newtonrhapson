USAGE:

Newton-Rhapson Method:

newtonMethod(f,Xn,k)

  "Returns an approximate root of f, given a point Xn, with k turns"

  f: function to find its roots. f has to be such that f: [a, b] -> R differentiable. We will find its roots between [a,b].
  
  Xn: candidate close to the root.
  
  k: iterations that will be made.

derivative(f, x)
  "Derivative of f in x"
  
  f: f has to be such that f: [a, b] -> R differentiable.
  x: a number in [a,b], in R.
